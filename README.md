This code implements a flashcard game where users are prompted with questions and can input their answers, receiving immediate feedback on their correctness. The game tracks user performance across multiple rounds, calculates the percentage of correct answers, and provides a summary at the end of each round.

## Test Files Organization

Similar to feature code, your test code needs to be put in a specific place for it to run successfully.

**Put all of your test files in the `test` directory.** As a convention, all test filenames should end with `-test.js`. For instance: `card-test.js`.

## Running Your Tests

Run your test suite using the command:

```bash
npm test
```
